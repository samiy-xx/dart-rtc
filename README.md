Here be Dragons!!  
Very much work in progress.

There's 2 samples of this running.

    [Example](http://loosebyte.com/demo/data-channel-chat, "Datachannel chat")  
    Datachannel chat, which requires Chrome >= v25 with datachannel flag set

    [Example2](http://loosebyte.com/demo/channel-video, "Video conferencing")  
    Video conferencing. Requires Chrome version >= 24 and webcam.  
    If you dont have webcam, you can fake it with software like manycam.com (windows)
